# A Shy Worm : Pixel Game Jam 2024
My game submission for Pixel Game Jam 2024 - Theme: Aqua

In "A Shy Worm," you navigate underwater environments filled with various creatures, aiming to avoid contact with other animals. As a shy worm, you are an antisocial entity that strives to stay away from others while surviving in a harsh social world.

The main concept I wanted to explore was boid simulation, which I have always found fascinating. Inspired by Sebastian Lague's video on boid simulation, I realized this could fit well with the aqua theme, as fish often exhibit this behavior in nature. By incorporating this mechanism, I believe it creates an engaging environment and challenging patterns for players to navigate.

## Credits

I would like to thank kidscancode for their steering manager Python file and tutorial videos, which were instrumental in developing the steering mechanics for this game. Their resources significantly shortened my development time by providing a solid foundation to build upon.

Additionally, credit goes to Sebastian Lague for his informative video on boid simulation. His explanations helped me grasp the underlying logic, directly enabling me to implement these mechanics in my game.
